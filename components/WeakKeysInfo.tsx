        <p>
          Unlike its predecessor DES, AES does not have any weak or semi-weak
          keys. This is due to the strong key schedule and the large key size
          (128, 192, or 256 bits) used in AES.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          In cryptography, a weak key is a key that, when used, results in the
          cipher behaving in an undesirable way. For AES, the key schedule
          algorithm is designed to eliminate weak keys. The large key space and
          the complex key expansion process make it extremely unlikely for weak
          keys to exist in AES.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Semi-weak keys, which are pairs of keys that produce the same
          encrypted result, are also not a concern in AES. The robust design of
          the algorithm ensures that every key produces a unique mapping of
          plaintext to ciphertext.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          In practice, the security of AES relies more on proper implementation,
          secure key management, and protection against side-channel attacks
          rather than concerns about weak or semi-weak keys.
